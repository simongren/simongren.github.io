abstract: "When casting their vote, retrospective voters take into consideration the incumbent’s policies since the last election. However, it is unclear whether voters care about the outcomes of those policies or about what the policy proposals revealed about the government that made them. To test this, we use granular data on Swedish local election results from 2002 to 2018 and the case of widely unpopular school closure proposals, some of which were implemented and others not. We exploit within municipality variation in voting over time to causally estimate the consequences for incumbents in the neighborhood surrounding the schools. Our results confirm that even if the school remains open, voters punish the incumbent: they consider the initial proposal as informative for their vote. Our findings have implications for the understanding of democratic accountability and which information voters take into account when casting their vote."
