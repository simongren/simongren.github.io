abstract: "Wind energy expansion has influenced electoral behavior by decreasing support for incumbents, mostly explained by not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) arguments. However, how does the establishment of wind farms shape electoral behavior when municipal politicians have the right to veto establishments? And to which parties do voters turn when parties that are more negative towards wind energy construct them? By analyzing Sweden, this study shows that voters not only respond by retrospectively evaluating past constructions but also evaluate parties differently depending on their expectations. While both left- and right-wing parties can be punished if wind turbines are built, if parties whose supporters are more negative about building turbines are responsible for their construction, the support for the opposition substantially increases. Similar effects are not as clear when more wind-friendly parties are responsible. Wind farm expansion is thus not a zero-sum game between different parties, but its electoral effects are dependent on the expectations that voters have."
