I am currently a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

My dissertation focuses on examining the impact of various forms of welfare service provision on citizens, with a particular emphasis on the marketization of the educational sector in Sweden. I study both the effects on service quality and cost, as well as the consequences for the interaction between citizens and the government.
