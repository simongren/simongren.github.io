I am currently a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

My research interests revolve around the impact of different forms of welfare service provision on citizens, particularly focusing on the case of the marketization of the educational sector in Sweden. I study both the effects on the quality and cost of the provided services and the consequences for the interaction between citizens and the government.
